\maketitle
This is an application for a Study Trip to Germany from 1.12.2013 till
12.12.2013. The objective is to take a group of bright Colombian students to
leading German institutes in the area of Astronomy in order to take lectures,
develop small research projects and have a clear picture of what it
takes to pursue graduate studies in Germany. 

This application is done under the A-Modality, whereby the DAAD takes
most of the responsibility for the logistics of the trip. However, we
are willing to make the trip under the B-Modality where we take full
responsibility to make all the logistic arrangements. The trip will
focused on three cities: Heidelberg, Potsdam and Tautenburg. In total
seven different Universities/Institutes will be visited.

The group is composed by the 15 most promising young astronomers in
Colombia. They come from seven different universities and five different
cities. The most important selection criteria were academic excellence,
promise to be great researchers and passion for astronomy.

In the next section we present a detailed justification for this trip,
a detailed itinerary and the preparation process before the
trip. Attached as an annex are the Invitation Letters from Germany and
the Letters of Support from Colombia.

\section{Justification}

Astronomy is key scientific area for development. It attracts young
minds to the study of math, sciences and engineering. It's an area
that ultimately tries to answer deep questions related to our
cosmic origins while making ground-breaking progress to build new
telescopes, instruments and detectors.

Colombia is a country where this knowledge are is starting to develop
at Universities. Since 2008 there exists the Colombian Congress for
Astronomy and Astrophysics (COCOA), which has held three meetings ever
since in Medellin, Bogot\'a and Bucaramanga with a strong attendance
of 100+ people including researchers, students and guests. During the
last COCOA 2012 in Bucaramanga, we realized that developing Astronomy
in Colombia crucially depends on building stronger bonds of
collaboration among all the researchers in the country and giving the
best opportunities to the youngest generation. Organizing a school
with students from all over the country in Germany seemed to be a
great way to reach that goal. 

With scientific contacts in Heidelberg, Potsdam and Tatenburg we
decided to focus the school in those cities. The common theme is
Extragalactic Astrophysics given that its already one of the strongest
research areas in Colombia. 

{\bf School's philosophy and structure}. The main objective of the school is
two-fold. First, get the students to interact as much as possible with students and
researchers. Second, give the students the opportunity to get first
hand information on how to pursue graduate studies in Germany.  This
is why we have structured the mornings with presentations highlighting
the science done at each institute and the structure of graduates
schools in Germany. The afternoons are devoted to work on small
projects together with PhD students and postdocs. There will also be
two opportunities (one in Potsdam, the other in Heidelberg) where the
students will have the possibility to give short talks to present
their results.

{\bf About the student group}. With the above mentioned objectives we
decided to look for the most promising undergrad students in
Colombia.  We look for three elements in the students: academic
excellence, potential to be researchers and passion for astronomy. We
also required that the students should be fluent in English.

With these requirements with ended up with an heterogeneous group of
students. All of them are between the third and tenth semester of
their undergraduate careers. They all have experience with small
research projects and a solid knowledge of basic subjects 
(mechanics, electromagnetism, calculus and programming) needed to
get the most out of the winter school. Most of them have also spent
time abroad in summer schools.  There are a few that are ready to
start their masters in 2014. Nevertheless, as a preparation to attend
the school we will hold a seminar on basic subjects of Extragalactic
Astronomy\footnote{This is explained in detailed in Section
  \ref{sec:preparation} of this document}.


{\bf About the professor leading the group}. Jaime E. Forero-Romero
is an astrophysicist and assistant professor in the Physics Department
at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogota (Colombia). He studied
Physics at the \'Ecole Normale Sup\'rieure in Paris and holds a PhD in
Physics given by the \'Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure de Lyon. He lived four 
years in Berlin while being a postdoc (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter)
at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics. In 2011 Gruber Fellowship by the
International Astronomical Union to spend one year in the Astronomy
Department at UC Berkely as a postdoctoral researcher in the galaxy
formation group. He still keeps an active scientific collaboration
with the Cosmology Group in Potsdam.

{\bf Professors and Colombian Universities supporting this application}. This application was
possible with the help of many other astronomy researchers in
Colombia, who performed the student selection and helped to shape this
proposal. They are: Giovanni Pinz\'on and Gregorio
Portilla(Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional), Luis N\'u\~nez and
Jerson Reina (Universidad Industrial de Santander), C\'esar Valenzuela
(Universidad del Valle), Edilberto S\'anchez (Universidad Distrital -
Bogo\'ta), Nelson Vera (Universidad Pedag\'ogica y Tecnol\'ogica de
Colombia) and Jorge Zuluaga (Universidad deAntioquia). 


\section{Preparation to the School}
\label{sec:preparation}

As a preparation to the trip the Postgraduate seminar of the Astronomy
group will be open to all the students participating in the
school. For the students living in Bogota (half of the students in
the group) we will meet in person on a weekly basis at Universidad de
los Andes. For the students of the outside Bogota we will work with
their tutors in each city so they can follow the same themes as in
Bogota. Once every month we will meet virtually via teleconferences in
order to discuss the advances and themes of that month. The seminar
will be held in English as training for the school. 

This 4-month seminar will have the following timeline.
\begin{itemize}
\item First Month Present basic concepts on the theme of the School
  (Extragalactic Astronomy)
\item Second Month. Get to know the research subjects of the groups at
  the Institutes to be visited in Germany.
\item Third Month. Pick two (2) of these reserach subjects to contact
  the tutors in Germany to ask for introductory literature.
\item Fourth Month. Develop in depth the beginning of the small
  research projects to be finished during the visit to Germany. 
\end{itemize}

The mechanics of the seminar will be 20 minute-long presentations by the
Lecturer, visiting scientists and the students. We will follow the
scheme used during the second semester of 2012 in the Undergraduate
Astronomy seminar at Universidad de los Andes\footnote{See this
